# COVID-19-ES
The expert system was developed using:
* React JS
* Python - Flask
* Prolog
<p>
ReactJS acted as the front-end tool from which the user could make requests to the Flask RESTFul API in order to carry out COVID-19 query functions. The Flask API is the backend infrastructure where endpoints could be called and actions took place. The API connected to a prolog knowledge base where facts and rules were configured and queried. In saving patient information a patients.txt file was used in storing and retrieving needed information to be analyzed and sent back to the user.
